## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

This was a nice way to practice using the CSS I learned to create something completely on my own, without someone instructing me. I learned how to position elements using absolute and relative, which was a bit difficult to grasp.

### Continued development

I will need to focus more on media queries, as they can be a bit tricky.
